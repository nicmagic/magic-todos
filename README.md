# Magical Todo

A simple application we've written for a code review assessment that is part of our hiring process at Magic.

## To Setup

You'll need Node installed in your local environment.

Clone the project from the GitHub repo. From the project directory, run `npm` to install the application and dependencies.

```
$ npm install -g .
```

## Getting to Know the Application

Take a few minutes to get acquainted with the codebase.

The application (when finished) will be a simple CLI (command line interface) to manage a to-do list.

There are tests (written in Jest).

## How to use

1. list all todos
```
$ magic todos ls
```
returns
```
TODOS:
ID1: cook food
ID2: clean
ID3: save the world
```

2. add todo
```
$ magic todos add ToDoItem
```

## The Pull Request

The application is not complete. Previous commits have set up a basic structure and dependencies for the application.

A pull request will be added. Your task will be to review the pull request and perform a code review.

## The Code Review

You can review the code in advance of our meeting and make comments using GitHub. If you don't have time to prepare, you can wait until we meet to make suggestions.

You'll find a few simple errors. But like a real code review, you'll also notice things that are matters of good judgment.

We are interested in the following:

- your suggestions to improve the code
- your process of reviewing code
- how you communicate as a reviewer

Assume that the pull request was created by an *inexperienced* JavaScript developer who was in a hurry to meet a deadline. You should look for problems with:

- basic JavaScript knowledge that a beginner should know
- good programming practices that an experienced developer should follow
- issues of usability
- development practices that might be obvious from the commit history
- unit tests

If you are unsure about syntax, feel free to use Google or other resources to check.

## To Uninstall

When you are done, you can remove the project.

```
$ npm uninstall -g magical-todo
```
